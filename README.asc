adoc
====
A simple asciidoc template and configuration script.

Sets up the Asciidoc toolchain on a Vagrant ubuntu64/trusty box.

The preqs.sh script and subsequent bundler may run on most Ubuntus; YMMV.

My impression is that there are many dependencies and failure modes in this toolchain, so building it in its own VM is helpful. I intend to pursue a Docker build time permitting.

Installs:

* prereqs and https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/[Ruby 2.2.1] (built from source)
* http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/INSTALL.html[asciidoc]
* https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/[apache fop]
* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoctor/[asciidoctor]
* various other stuff (see https://github.com/CharlesTBetz/adoc/blob/master/Gemfile[Gemfile])
* http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/asciidoc-bib/2.3.1[asciidoc-bib]

It then renders the simple document contained in the following files:

----
├── adoc.asc
├── Chap-01
│   ├── Chap-01-Sec-00.asc
│   ├── Chap-01-Sec-01.asc
│   ├── Chap-01-Sec-02.asc
│   └── images
│       └── cat.jpg
├── Chap-99
│   ├── Chap-99-Sec-00.asc
│   ├── Chap-99-Sec-01-appendices.asc
│   └── Chap-99-Sec-02-references.asc
----

into

* adoc.html and an images directory
* adoc.pdf (asciidoc render)
* adoc2.pdf (asciidoctor render)

At this writing, the community intent seemingly is to deprecate asciidoc in favor of asciidoctor. I discovered different behaviors between asciidoc and asciidoctor pdf rendering in a complex document and currently include both in this build.

asciidoc-bib is included but not currently exercised in the document or rendering script. It would require the creation of a *.bib file.

I recommend https://atom.io/[Github Atom] with the https://github.com/asciidoctor/atom-asciidoc-preview[Asciidoc preview plugin] for WYSIWYG editing.
